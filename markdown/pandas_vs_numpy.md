# `Pandas` vs. `Numpy`
## `pandas` Library
- Works with **DataFrames**
  -  e.g., `.csv` documents
- "Skeleton" code:
  ```py
  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.DataFrame(data)
  ```


---
## `numpy` Library
- Works with **arrays**
  - Use for MATLABish tasks
- "Skeleton" code:
   ```py
   import numpy as np
   myarray = np.array([1, 2])
   ```
